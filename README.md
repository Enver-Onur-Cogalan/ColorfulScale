# Colorful Scale Animation

This is a simple React Native project demonstrating a colorful scale animation using the Animated API.  
A yellow-to-orange scaling box is animated when the user taps the "Animate" button. The component smoothly scales up, shrinks, and returns to its original size while changing its background color in the process.
